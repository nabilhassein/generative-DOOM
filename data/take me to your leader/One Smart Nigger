Hey whitey, you and your punk friends killed my man
(Please, don't kill me, I didn't mean to do it

We must not sit back and be spectators
We must um (Killing is good), uh, uh, then we must uh, take a position
And if we're taking any (Killing blacks) meaningful or useful action, then that's our responsibility also
You disgusting men are filled with deceit

You won't get away with this cracker
(Men, he's to stop me)
You must all prepare yourself for what will happen
African diversity is substantially greater, significantly greater than diversity of Saharan African
Uh, this is what you would expect in an older population
The original population of anatomically modern humans
They know exactly what they're doing
Fiction or drama
God has chosen to him to lead him to victory
(That's all I need to know from you)
They claim power in the name of God and they control people through fear and suffering and cold blooded murder but now that's going to end
Look out the window
