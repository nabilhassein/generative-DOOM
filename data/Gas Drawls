By the way, I re-up on bad dreams, bag up screams in fiftys
Be up on mad schemes that heat shop like jiffy-pop(pop)
In a instant get smoked like Winston Cigarettes
Ho's get ripped off like Nicorette patch
In real life the real trife scene
Might snatch ya life like assault machine
Rifle, dead up setup like bull-fight
Be blunted how we like couldn't white or in full flight
The unemotional call me anti-social
On the run off the gun death tally commercial
Death valley is like rehearsal to the streets
To my peeps G.M MF on the beat
Rhymes is chosen like the weapons of war
So keep from steppin on my floor or delivery front door
I bring it to ya'll motherfuckers master yours
My disaster cause: Hell.. in gas drawls
The supervillain cooler than a million, I be chillins
Still quick to slice squares like Sicilians
Dont make me have to hurt them feelings
I'll ruin you in the dirt that I be doin in my dealings (WHILE I’M)
Sendin spirits through the ceilin', chrome peelin'
Dome blown within the comforts of your own home
Grown big wheelin' and high rollin'
I hold the lye, it keeps the sty on my eye swollen'
Holdin, foldin the pal
Known as massive-versatile
I’d like to big-em-up monster isle
Uummm, Yeah
I saw you in Hell with them gas drawls
Mhm
To my brother Subroc and Black Ju
I crack brew for, two more, three men, two up
I hit the brew up like nobody knows how X the unseen feels
When giving crews a brush with death like between meals
Two times a day with brothers that's tight like a noose
With more rhymes in use than Dr. Seuss or motherfuckin' mother goose
X the suspicious flirter
Who every hooker hearda', next to malicious murda'
A track type vicious fulfillin the pipe wishes
The misses may be legal minus the baby eagle
Any given summer's eve don't breathe
Sixteen shots I do believe and one up the sleeve
Master of the O who predict ya last pause
I told y'all, Hell and gas drawls
Breakin glass and plastic jaw like federal drastic law
Fed up from fightin' secret war wit' them Fantastic Four (invisible bitch)
Versus Doom wit' the metal face before I go to state
The ho better settle case
The flow is at pedal pace steady like tricycles
Beware all suckas is froze like icicles (bag 'em up)
And baggin' bitches like nickels
Cause I licked 'em where they tickle before I hit the clit though
I'ma split till I pronounce More hits than a ounce no doubt
About ta bounce, X the unannounced, I'm out
And I like to give a shoutout to the brother Jet Jaguar
Megalon and King Geedorah
I call this joint right here Gas Drawls
In Hell with yours
