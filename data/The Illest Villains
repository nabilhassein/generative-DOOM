"Don't touch that!"
"The villains themselves were ultimately responsible for much of the popularity, audiences loved to hate

"What's the matter... I was only tryin' to have fun—"
"Get to work on these boys, anybody bring a gun for me?"

"Two historical figures, outlaws and desperadoes if that, the villainous pair of really nice boys who just happened to be on the wrong side of the law, three hundred and sixty degrees.

"Madvillain, more accurately, the dark side of our beings"
