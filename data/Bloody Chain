...Had this one bitty, she gave good brain
Used to come and see me in the hood on the train
One way cost a buck 50
Not a bad loss if you sure to suck her titty
At least for better or for worse
Nails was more faker than the letters on her purse
Not quite the Gucci butters
No drawers, coochie cutters
And the hoochie stuttered
"Y-y-y-y-ou got another Deski-kid?"
She listened to that rap shit
V was out of touch with
Lit it, hit it raw with no fuss
Only thing she said was
"J-J-Just pull out before you b-bust"
Lightskin from hell
V drink gin, she sipped white zinfandel
Maybe I'll make her to my baby mother
Then she had to break out to babysit her baby brother
To show her she was iller than the next chick is
He reached in the drawer and let her sport one of the necklaces
He gave her change for a token (*kiss*)
Get at me when you get to where you going
Got a call later that night and was heart broken
My man was like "Your girl just got bodied, I'm not joking
Fucked up real bad, she ain't make it
Stuck her with a cutter, she wouldn't let him take the shit"
I'm like "My shorty got stabbed
Off the piece of shit chain I had nabbed off a crab"
Wouldn't give it up so I put one in his ab
Grabbed the bloody chain and took a cab to the lab
I knew I should've sold it to the Arab
My shorty got stabbed off the same bloody chain
....(Yeah!Yeah!)Late nite club nite Pen attract fights
Slumped in the corner click clackin dice
All my fam left they was high drunk or fuckin asked If I'm safe dolo
I'm from bed stuy its nuthin
Cuz told me to murk I wasn't listenin
My girls went to work trips & 456n em
Chain just glistenin lookin all gaudy
Plus the scratch I'm winnin got me lookin all flossy
40 after 40 stogie after stogie
Stumbled out the after hours without no homies
Forgot where I parked tried to hop in a cab
Some dude wit a mask said drop it in the bag
Now I'm not used to bein a victim
One of them club dudes had the same jeans & kicks on
That ass bettin loser this ain't right
But ain't no protocol when u shootin dice
Tried to put up a fight but I was too nice
Coordination fucked up caught one in the gut
Freaked out thought it was worse than it was
Cause all that blood dispersed from my gut
Out the infirmary just a flesh wound
But still felt funny when I tried to digest food
Back to the hood and I layed low
Runnin low on pesos need another game to enhance my payroll
This time ain't no one sleep
Had the rambo on me let my cousin hold the heat
I'm mad sober see what happened last time I got my drink on
Hold up! She got my link on?
The bow legged ho must think somethin sweet
She didn't even switch up the piece
Maybe she ain't know, think her man bought it
Then give ya man this for me, just cut her
(*Girl screaming*)
