You gotta watch your gums on this
But it's, it's very good, it's very healthy
(Not perfect for every situation but edible wrappers could actually beef up your next meal)
You would only want to use the wraps when there's no food associated with the use of the wraps
So, uh, some potential uses include, um, wrapping bolt packed in a larger package
And in that case, the, the wrap will actually form into a sauce when you cooked, cooked your meats
Um, there's also been interest in, um, development of using the wrap and then actually rip up the wrap in case you will get weary the next day
(It's hoped edible wrappers will do a couple of things
Create a new demand for produce
Stop throwing out as much garbage as they do
And eat more chitlins)
