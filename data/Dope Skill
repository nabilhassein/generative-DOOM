It's Vik
Known to kick a no joke vocal
And given a chance, yoke ya slow poke local yokel
Don't smoke krill, won't need topal
If the fluoride don't kill ya then the soap will
Dope skill, nickname Musty
All up in the popes grill with quick game and crusty
He said "Trust me, what's the dang fuss B?"
Let me hold the buggy, police can't bust me
It should only take five minutes
No jive bidness, I leave no live witness
For you? Two percent on the back
And not only that, I let you get on the track
Holla back, he still ain't call
It ain't my loss boss, ball till ya fall
So what? A low cut price and pro
V'll sell a bogus marriage liscense to a mo
Like sellin weed to a thug
Candy that baby gave me--"I need a new drug"
He knew the blue was too bug
After school he used to sip brew by the jug
Enough to piss barley
Cracker told 'em chill before ya end up like Chris Farley
He said "yes'm Mr. Charlie"
Now kindly shut the fuck up I'm tryin ta twist this Marley
Dope skill!
("You're nothing!" is being scratched'n'cut)
Enough to piss barley
Cracker told 'em chill before ya end up like Chris Farley
(*Rap line being scratched'n'cut*)
Turn a live Saturday night to a maniac Monday
Disturb ya inner peace with this rap feng shui
Knock you out a position wit a rendition
Just a little somethin to tivo on your television
The first cat to spit a verse on star search
The only American idol ta spill a rap recital
Win a contract, then turn it down willingly
And start a bidding war that'll collapse the whole industry
Then put it out independantly
Cuz all them gifts they sendin me, just ain't bendin me
The only thing a major can give me is advice
While local cats tell me I'm just not that nice
But I don't feel bad at all after peepin their catalog
Knowin all along they always bumpin the wackest songs
Chalkin a plan with the future at hand
Being the last to stand after da band disbands
Enough to piss barley
Cracker told 'em chill before ya end up like Chris Farley
..Enough to piss barley
Cracker told 'em chill before ya end up like Chris Farley
(*"Damn right!" is being scratched'n'cut*)
