1,2 1,2 yes!
Yo, it's King Ghidra, combined with the forces of nine ether
Blowing woofers and tweeters, shaking syllable meters
Disaster's cataclysmic, mystic natural, it's about time
We hit you with some substance that's actual
I got a gift call, hip-hop prophecy
Since 2003 ends the reign of the jiggy MC
No more roaming on this planet like scavengers
Scientists broke the code of the Gregorian calendar
Defying laws of space and time, trying to trace my lines
Hold up, respect the architect
Digital Roland, my whole crew roll with VS
Type to master this whole universe in three steps
We stretch across the equator with something major
Universal rhyme tones, tamper with ya timezone
Minds blown by the millions just for the feeling
Hip-hop, it just don't stop until I make a killing
Nah I'm kidding, but for real
The world ain't the same no more
Take your life to next level or remain no more
Take your life to next level or remain no more
Word up, word up
Well I'm colliding with the mind of a
Survivor surviving, uncover the time brother
The high volume wide column, Height slalom
Preferred jog on the side
Dodgin' mirages, conquer the vibe, hunger lurks
Nine to five work saga, god bless the life
Father trife, travel to light
Balance the globe off life, vocal pimpin' it's throat
So you know how we go down yo
Struggle in the ghetto yo
Metal throat, settle the dough, live showbiz
The cannonball, weapon, Man At Arms
Four section, super intelligence, balance
Benevolent, stinging nettle medicine
Crouch tiger, dragon , craftmatic
Watch ya back, if, catch this
Fascist through the atlas, first class diplomatic status
Stagma flag, then overstanding the plan
Bar scan, identify camera shots
Streets watch, Timex clocks
Punch lunch on the dot, five minutes to rock
So we blue-block cruise, it's old news how we do...
I'm a drop one rhyme, for every time I cross the thin line
Between yours and mine, see, it's part of my design
Shifting paradigm, Yin and yang combined, must be out ya mind
Thinking Stahhr would never shine
Props due, focus with a hawk's eye view
I'm all that, a plantain, and some Ital stew
Gettin' spinach, British, ATL to Venice
Even Abercrombie figures open off of this verb elixir
Magnetic attraction,  raw as Millie Jackson
Straight open in the caption, here comes the hix and braxton's
Lyrical contraction, delivery reaction, it started with a passion, that's just the way it happened
Born with umbilical cords strapped to Korgs
Won't drop a Kurzweil plus those zip disk files?
Sharp with the needles, found no IV's for the feeble
Y'all fiending for the sequel and the beat's not even EQ'd....
"We have a snake to catch!"
