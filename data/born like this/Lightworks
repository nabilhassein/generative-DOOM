What is the magic that makes one's eyes
Sparkle and gleam, light up the skies
The name of the game is lightworks
I see you're peein' in you pants little sissy boy
Jerks...
Welcome to the Octagon
Lay a player flat before the trainer felt his clock was on
Keep your socks torn, it's a box-a-thon
With hard rock Black, Rock & Ron's goin' Barbizon
Curled up beggin, layin on the canvas
Instead of in the ready position like praying mantis
Scissors, Lanvis, grand fist sandwich, stance switch
Slammed on, stitches twitch, hands itch, damn snitch
Any street corner could be the platform till we defeat gone and wander
Watch your mouth jaw, southpaw, outs floor
Doubt your clout more, bout roar, outscore boy
Off the leash like UFC
Off the beat, off ya feet like two lefties
FUB's, heffer please, lost a few to stew beef
New referees, what a remarkable team, show your teeth
The shine that sparkles and gleams
Light up the signs the name of the game is the lightworks
Light up the spliffs the name of the game is lightworks
Wipe off slight smirks
The match was mapped out
Get jabbed and crap-slapped out, tapped out
Either the lunch bin or choke hold time
Munchkins get punched in like vocal rhyme
The shine that sparkles and gleams
Light up the signs the name of the game is the lightworks
Light up the spliffs the name of the game is lightworks
The right hurts
