If you're waiting for a parade there ain't none
Sharpen up your spirit of adventure
The fabulous gay way
Hey what's the big idea
Yeah
I have no ideas, in fact I'm quite bewildered
Now don't get gay with me
Gay, sir
I'm far from gay
Now listen and keep your shirt on
Grown men in a rubber suit
Runnin' around with a young boy
Homo
Oh shoot, get a load of that fruit
In thigh-high boots, red tighty-whities and blue cat suit
Holy homos
Even the rats know it’s tacky
'You ever see me slippin' like that bitch, just smack me'
Posin' Chester, legs open, couldn’t stand worse
All was missin' was a bandana and a man purse
Cryin', dyin', laughin' til glands burst
Faster than a speeding glass, bleeding-ass ran first
Fixin' baby hair, messed up wavy curl
Under the cape the back of the S say baby girl
The things some people‘ll do for fame
It’s an herb, it’s a lame
It’s... a Goddamn shame
Villain willing when them cold streets call
You can keep your hero and hold the meatballs
Worthy title, lock it with pockets on empty
He work harder than a steam engine like John Henry
Turn dirt to dollars like Don Henley
Ugly and still get hollers like Ron Jeremy
At least monetarily terribly
MC's need therapy, it’s like a fairy spree
Hit him with a kryptonite brick
Children come and prick his dead body with a stick
Wrote this lyric from in the bed with a chick
She had the tightest grip around the head of my
...Bic, now can I get my pen back
Got no enemy, got no friend, black
With the Green Goblin got the Batcave robbed
Bust in Batman’s head bobbin’, slobbin’ Robin’s knob
Y’all already got your belts on the floor so
Kick them shits over here and click off the porno
Alfred come home and found them both nekkid
Handcuffed to each other just as he had suspected
Red and chrome Batmobile, wheelin‘ and dealin’
Aquaman's sleepin' with the fishes, for real for squealin’
Pss the lo-lo on a seal skin blazer
It’s just a little graze from a razor-thin laser
Amazed at all these so-called wannabe players
Showin' off they titballs to all the free-gayers
It’s like a leotard fest
How it got started is any retards guess
Regardless, that’s they choice, no hate debate
Becomes a problem when they try an attempt to go straight
And raise the monster rate in the whole population
It’s starting to affect the super pimpin’ occupation
Now, who’s the hater, headline the newspaper
Fate of a fake you out caped crusader
Tied to the tracks, make a damn tram derail
Rap is like scam spam Nigerian e-mail
The man with no beard is more weirder than a she-male
Sucker got bagged on a Temazepam street sale
Told ‘em one of ours set it up, yeah doubt
Did it like the dirty drawls
Wet ‘em up and air it out
You got any money
What
You got any money
Man you gone crazy
Damn
Batman's gay
Bhati boys
