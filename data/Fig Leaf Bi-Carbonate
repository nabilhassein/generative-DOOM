Well anyway
You may be saying about now
"How in the world is that old fella eat all of that crazy stuff
And not get sick to his stomach?"
Haha, well, don't worry about that
You see, whenever I make a pig of myself on the filet
Or the pudding or something
I mix up some herbs and
I come up with a dandy glass of this
Bicarbonate of fig leaf
That'll set me free, I'll tell you
Ugh
Edible wrappers may be in grocery stores as soon as months from now
You've heard of good to the last drop
Well your food could soon be good to the last bite
Wow! That was loud!
Got to ya, huh?
Here's an interesting note: artificial colors
Yellows or Reds
Let's focus on the red
In addition to FD&C Red Number 40, the FDA has approved certain food coloring additives, some are actually POISON!
If you aren't sure of the additives or colorings in the products you've purchased, LEAVE IT ALONE!
POISON!
BAD NEWS!
THAT'S RIGHT!
Thank you
Well, I think that about covers all of the natural foods out here
Now then, I have to go take my dessert here
I have to go
I'm conducting a cooking class today
Good health to you all!
Uh, over this way
Look out!
Alright Pops, still feel like charging me for that meal?
One look at his feature-less face
One look was enough to ensure his safety
As years passed, he became even more bitter and angry
Burning with vengeance against the world
Finally, amidst hidden scrolls, he found what he'd been seeking
Then, clothed in a suit of invulnerable armor, and possessing the worlds greatest secrets of science and magic, he returned to his homeland
And there he has remained
Scheming, dreaming, planning
Plotting his mad campaign to conquer the entire world
(I can't believe it!)
(Alright, don't make a big deal about it)
I warn you Doom, you've gone too far
(Yeah!)
That'll do it Doom
