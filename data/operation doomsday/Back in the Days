It was back in the days when I met a brilliant student named DOOM
Hello? Anybody home?
Wow, look at that equipment
I wonder what DOOM is working on
Now I'll just rearrange a few of these circuits
What are you doing in my room?
You're even more stupid than I thought
Give me those papers
I just came by to say hello
But you'd better recheck those equations
You're off a few decimals
And that means big trouble if you use this material
Get out of here
