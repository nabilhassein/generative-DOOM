Young blood, he's smart and he's tough
But he's got a lot to learn about survival
And the man he's gonna learn from is...
Doom!
Uh, lay in the cut like a puma on the prowl
The right time to get 'em is now, clow
That's the end of that, beginning of a never-ending saga
Of how he gets it in like Kamagra
Cheers here's a lager, yours is O'Doul’s
These are from the untold rules of the old school
It’s like a woolah what it do to one’s medulla oblongata
Revenge of Montezuma on a blotter
(Yo, this track's off the rack DOOM)
It's that clack clack boom
Like what's contained in a square centimeter of the vacuum
When lava rock cool who play the block fool
Villain get paid laid back like chacmool
Enough to make Pac drool wherever he at
Invest wealth, impress self check ace stat
Damn mask gets stickier than crack sweat
In the corner pocket that's gained some aspect
(Casket) and yet still blow like gasket
Many ass out, no clout, no smash hit
And that's it, plan B, let the tools spark
Plan A's a shoe-in, straight shootin' like a pool shark
Rack 'em up, just don't quit your old job
Small trolls whose type slob on poll blog
You know you done fucked up now, like O-Dog the menace
It's all love, play tennis
The mic is the shotty, forget about the flack vest
They hustle is backwards, whack -- it's tactless
That don't count, chickens before they hatch in the basket
Body beats, closed casket
Bishop!
I'm moving with the all black tactic
Black kicks, black jeans, black jacket matchin'
I'm pulling 21s like I'm using black magic
And they thinking that I am because the quality's fantastic
They told me I should focus on scholastics
And others told me focus on elastic
I'm using both of those as a tactic
As I mix it with my passion for the rappin'
To think I could have been trappin'
I'm happy I wasn't trapped in
The loop de loop and shootin'
I'm moving through the mind pollution, tryna find solution
But I'm only closer to dilution
The illusions are leading me to delusion
I'm sick of being confused and I don't have much of a fuse
So I lack getting amused, feeling actively abused
More days of the blues, I'm waiting on the clues
Alone as I cruise through life and all its waters
Must have hit some ice-bergs because its feeling like torture
It's H-O-R-S-E, I'm Jordan, in '96
I'm sinking everything man, still I'm playing for the chips
So basically, I'm saying I'm sinking my own ship
You can think what you want cause your thoughts ain't important
I'm feeling blanker than a CD ROM
And all I ever wanted was for them to see these rhymes
They telling me be patient, I ain't got the time
Cause I'm seeing trash rappers getting over night shine
While I'm still behind, and they ask why I whine
Is it because I'm living off the thoughts in my mind
Or is it I'm just livid because nobody is complying
I see that I'm inspiring the moves of these sirens
But how could I be vibrant?
Only thing I'm close to is violence
So hurry up and cue all the violins
Looking from a vile lens
Ever since the girl I was eyeing for prom
Ain't wanna tag along, it's something that I long
But I understand the order though
Life's like a big playbook full of audibles
You never know the working play until you go toss a few
Packing rappers in caskets your boy Nehru
So the first thing you’re gonna have to do
If you decide that you’re going to be
Someone who thrives in times of hardship
And there are always those who thrive in times of hardship, aren’t there?
There are those who survive epidemics
There are those who thrive in hard times
In other words, we want you to step back far enough
You know how when you’re in your airplane
And you’re looking across the landscape
High in the sky, 500 miles an hour, 50 thousand feet in the sky
And you look down, and it all looks pretty calm
Down there, doesn’t it
Put it on the ground at that speed, not so calm
We’re encouraging you to take flight
We’re encouraging you to ba- ba- back up from it
Get a longer view and understand it
It is not possible for things to get worse in a universe that is expanding
But, this is something that you may begin to notice
As contrast exists, and it always will
And as everything is expanding, including contrast
As contrast becomes more, then asking becomes more
And when asking becomes more, and resistance stays strong
Then more people beat themselves up by not going with the flow
That’s all you’re seeing right now
But when you, as an individual, who can’t control what the others do
Let loose of your own resistance and go with the flow
Then you become one who experiences immediate thriving
Now this is the part about something you’re going to have to learn to do during this interim
It’s just a few months
You have to decide that you don’t care what others think of you
