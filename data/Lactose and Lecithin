"Hello I’m Dean Stockton of Eastern State University in America, and I am prepared to offer you a full science scholarship. Viktor, use the college. Use this scientific equipment to conduct strange, forbidden experiments."
Somewhere out in cop killing Queens
Where bo deans stop limousines and niggas flee the scene
Somebody on his back bleeding vest all cracked up
'Freeze clown officer down request for back up'
Listen dude don't get me misconstrued as a sniper
It's V Vaughn not to be confused with V la viper
Or either Peter Parker
Or either peter piper
A seed the type to pee the diaper blame it on the wiper
It's really not your concern why I got the knife sir
He suggest remain calm let's not get -- 'No!'
Slash his windpipe he had them type of eyes
He might be still alive
How you get this thing to hyper drive
Oh
Give my props to the shooter
Prices at a all time low in the future
Something like fourteen they must be on horse pills
O T and zero three to re up on force fields
At that cost, deal, he plotted the coordinates
Two thousand three winter time upper west side more or less
This thing be buggin like a celly frontin
Now who the hell is honey wit the slug in her belly stuntin
You ain't have to tell V nothing
Trust him
It really ain't no time for discussion
He'll be back in ninty three press of a button and they busted in
His first impulse was to smack the dirt
All four wore plain clothes and lumberjack shirt
Recognize one face from school six degrees ago
He'd snuff him in his braces just to switch the station to BGO
He kept a punch line every lunch break lunch time
And this is no time to pump fake it's crunch time
The same split second they let off the toast
That's when he hit the speed dial and sped off ghost
I know those cats don't like V
And if they took my head off they'd get off most likely
And probably thought the time gizmo was my wallet
And hit the hills forty more times on some foul shit
Pick a crime he was out in the nick of time
To get paid another day and live to kick a sicker rhyme
For iller, it's like Miller malt liquor time
Up town finery were it's probably not best to flaunt
Everyone's your best friend V steps into the restaurant
My friend, he said, you must be psychic
What's the price of- Fourteen!
It’s good, you like it!
Huh, be back tonight the fourteen G pack was really packed tight
But back at the lab he found that the Sleestak was right
Not only was it three cracks light but too white
The test show lactose, anbesol
Lecithin five types of aspirin and other kinds of medicines
Next time I'll bring my men who speak Mexican
And let the Techs spin
Make 'em contact the next of kin
The whole thing is mostly lactose
Lecithin and some type of aspirin, anbesol medicine
Damn
Lets go get 'em men
