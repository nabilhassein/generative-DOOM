Give me a little bit, a little bit
Just a little bit, or a lot
Pieces of the dream that I pick up in my mind
Is not blind, of our love
Every day when I look into your brown eyes
I get high, on our love
Pieces of the dream that I pick up in my mind
Is not blind, of our love
Every day when I look into your brown eyes
I get high, I get high
I, I get high, look in your, brown eyes
I get high-iiiiiiii-iiiiiii-iiiiiigh
Higher, higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher, you make me higher
I fly (I fly) I fly (I fly)
I fly (I fly) up high
I fly— take me there, I fly— take me there
I fly
