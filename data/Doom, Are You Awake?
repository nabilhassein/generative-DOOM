Doom, are you awake?
Yes, but what do you want?
You fool, it's a miracle that you didn't kill Costez as well as yourself. So, before you cause greater harm—
Get out of here! This is just a minor disappointment. I shall overcome it
The failure of DOOM's experiment did not end his tragedy
For a few days later, his bandages were removed
There. Aah! How horrible, that face
What have I done to myself? My face is...hideous! He made me hurry my experiment! Now I must hide my face from all mankind. But he will pay. Oh, how he will pay!
So after his face was ruined, he just seemed to disappear
Why did DOOM threaten just to—
Well, like I said he just disappeared. I'll never forgot that day
