Dudes is doin' fashion shows
JJ DOOM go pop, not so irrational
You see the cash it pull? Y'all know the M.O
Vil been killin' flows since back when "It's a Demo"
Or "Please Listen To My Demo", keep "The Crossover"
He been flippin' beats since Casio Bossa Nova
We need a chauffeur for the rover where they go 'fer
If you gotta ask, you ain't supposed to have it-- oh, uh
No duh. Silver with the mocha
Make sure it's turbo, jump a river with the joker broker
Stay-- about to flip
Never know what happen like a play without the script, out your lip
Get a grip on an A&R lapel
Repeatin' after meetin', everything swell -- ring bells
Mid-verse, hot sip drinking
It's a optical illusion, not lip-syncing
Thinking
Who's to know?
I know
You go
We all go
Right and wrong
Pop
I know
You go
We all go
Write the song
Bite the thong
Pop
In the world but not of it
Shove it above top secret buggedness, you gotta love it-- rub it
Go for the club kid. One hit wonder
Killin' it, a brilliant career move blunder
Clear blue thunder, rock 'n' roll the whole house, announce
The true hunter, knock a troll out, and bid-di-dounce
Skate... next time you see 'em
Straight jacket, Hip Hop Hall Of Fame museum
Or in a screen gem for the soundtrack
What's the meanin' of the theme? Is the clown wack?
It's all relative to how swell you live in the long run
Hell, tell a fib, get the song done
We the wrong ones, so don't even ask
It's hard enough tryna breathe up in the mask
They know the supervillain name, he stay gaming 'em
Paper front to fame
He learn from watchin' Dame 'n' them
And not blaming 'em
I know
You go
We all go
Whether it's right or wrong
Pop
I know
You go
We all go
Write the song
Bite the thong
Pop
